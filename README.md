# Books-and-Boba-Bakery-Website
A website for a Books and Boba Bakery
Created by Lilian Lim

# Overview
The project is to help showcase my skill set in HTML and CSS. I have always like books, boba, and bakery and wished that there was a store that has all three.

# Functionality Available 
In the project, you will be able to view the boba menu, the bakery menu, and fill out a contact form.

# Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap are used to create this project along with figma to help create a low fidelity wireframe. Google fonts is also used to support the styling of the fonts of the webpage. Pexels and unsplash are also websites used to find royalty free images to use on the website.

# Future improvements
A few future improvements I would like to implement is to have an ordering option on the page for boba and bakery items, have more information on the bookstore component of the store, and allow for reservations to be made via the website through a reservations page.
